# 🐆 Persian (Asiatic) Cheetah – Overview

## What is the Persian Cheetah?
The **Persian or Asiatic cheetah** (*Acinonyx jubatus venaticus*) is a critically endangered subspecies of the cheetah, found **only in Iran** today. It is genetically distinct from African cheetahs, having diverged **32,000–67,000 years ago**, making it an **Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU)**. Its extinction would erase the entire Asian branch of the cheetah family tree.

## 🌍 Taxonomy & Evolution
- **Family:** Felidae  
- **Genus:** *Acinonyx*  
- **Subspecies:** *A. j. venaticus*  
- Originated in **North America**, migrated to Eurasia ~100,000 years ago.  
- Survived two severe genetic bottlenecks, leaving extremely **low genetic diversity**.

---

## 🐾 Physical Traits
- **Weight:** 34–54 kg  
- **Length:** Up to 135 cm (body) + 84 cm (tail)  
- **Coat:** Pale, dense fur adapted to cold Iranian winters  
- **Adaptations:** Flexible spine, semi-retractable claws, long tail for balance  
- **Speed:** Up to 93 km/h in short sprints  

---

## 📉 Population Status
- **Current Wild Population:** Fewer than **30 individuals**  
- **Effective Population Size (Nₑ):** ~11–17 (critically low)  
- **Main Habitats:**  
  - **Northern Landscape:** Touran Biosphere Reserve & Miandasht Wildlife Refuge  
  - **Southern Landscape:** Naybandan & Bafq (functionally extinct)  

---

## ⚠️ Major Threats
- **Road Mortality:** Highways like Abbasabad-Mayami kill up to 40% of recorded cheetahs.  
- **Prey Loss:** Gazelle populations depleted by hunting and livestock competition.  
- **Human Conflict:** Shepherd dogs kill cubs; retaliatory killings occur.  
- **Genetic Collapse:** Inbreeding and disease vulnerability due to low diversity.  

---

## 🧬 Conservation Challenges
- Captive breeding is extremely difficult.  
- Famous cub **Pirouz** (born 2022) died at 10 months, showing the limits of ex-situ conservation.  
- Scientists propose:  
  - **Habitat Connectivity:** Restore corridors between North & South.  
  - **Road Fencing & Underpasses:** Prevent highway fatalities.  
  - **Genetic Rescue:** Introduce African cheetahs to boost diversity (controversial).  

---

## 🌟 Why It Matters
- **Ecological Role:** Apex predator controlling herbivore populations, preventing desertification.  
- **Evolutionary Heritage:** Unique adaptations for cold deserts lost forever if extinct.  
- **Cultural Symbol:** Featured in Persian literature and art as a symbol of speed and nobility.
